This is another attempt at rebooting my writing habits. I tried to write blog
posts again and again in the past, but I never managed to keep it up for long.
This time, I'm hoping to make it stick.

As a first step, I revamped this blog's design and structure. It is just pitch
black now. The stack is same. [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is still doing
the heavy lifting and GitHub pages is still hosting it for free. The design is
much more minimalistic now, focusing on content rather than flashy visuals. To
hell with designs.

I also plan to write more regularly. My goal is to publish at least one post
per month, mostly on work and life updates. Hope I can keep this up!
