This is my first time writing anything in a span of an year. I rarely wrote
anything in paper in this decade. When I did, it was mostly office work or
chores. I can even say I forgot the pleasure of having a pen on paper. It used
to be quite satisfying, and now I forgot that feeling. It is not an issue with
pen and paper though. The case is same with digital tools. Though I spend a lot
of time with my computer, I rarely write anything other than code. Code, on the
other hand, is not satisfying as it once used to be.

None of those issues are unique to me. Many of my friends and colleagues are
facing the same thing. I have neither the time nor the patience to investigate
why. Alas, maybe its the very reason why we are in such a situation. One thing
for sure is that it has to change, for better of-course.

This is not a petition to myself, nor this is an attempt at finding anything.
This is simply me trying to write something once again, even if this is not
paper. I made some progress in my career and overall personal life. But one I
miss is my willingness to spend time to read and write. Hopefully I may turn it
around this time. Mind you, this is not first time I tried to restart my habits
but I really hope this is the last.

I made some changes to this very website. It may not look prettier to you but
does to me, and I am happy with that :) I learned React in that past 4 months.
Its neither better nor worse than Vue. I kinda like it at times but not always.
More on it later.

In the meantime, welcome back - me to myself.
