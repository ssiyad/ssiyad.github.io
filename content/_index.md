My toolkit is pretty broad and includes a bunch of programming languages.
Python is my first love and go-to language for most use cases. I'm also pretty
handy with Typescript, which I use a lot for building applications that are
easy to maintain and can scale up real nice. When in need of a web frontend, I
often reach for Vue and Tailwind. Right now, I'm learning Rust, which is both a
challenge and a revelation. On top of all that, I really dig checking out the
latest and greatest technologies and messing around with them to learn new
things and keep up with the tech scene. If you're curious about my work, feel
free to check out some of my projects [here](https://github.com/ssiyad).

When not immersed in the world of coding, you can find me reading a book,
cheering for Arsenal, or exploring new places . If you're curious about my
travels, you can catch a glimpse through the photos I occasionally share on my
Instagram!
