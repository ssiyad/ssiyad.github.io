    <div class="post mb-4"><p>This is my first time writing anything in a span of an year. I rarely wrote
anything in paper in this decade. When I did, it was mostly office work or
chores. I can even say I forgot the pleasure of having a pen on paper. It used
to be quite satisfying, and now I forgot that feeling. It is not an issue with
pen and paper though. The case is same with digital tools. Though I spend a lot
of time with my computer, I rarely write anything other than code. Code, on the
other hand, is not satisfying as it once used to be.</p>
<p>None of those issues are unique to me. Many of my friends and colleagues are
facing the same thing. I have neither the time nor the patience to investigate
why. Alas, maybe its the very reason why we are in such a situation. One thing
for sure is that it has to change, for better of-course.</p>
<p>This is not a petition to myself, nor this is an attempt at finding anything.
This is simply me trying to write something once again, even if this is not
paper. I made some progress in my career and overall personal life. But one I
miss is my willingness to spend time to read and write. Hopefully I may turn it
around this time. Mind you, this is not first time I tried to restart my habits
but I really hope this is the last.</p>
<p>I made some changes to this very website. It may not look prettier to you but
does to me, and I am happy with that :) I learned React in that past 4 months.
Its neither better nor worse than Vue. I kinda like it at times but not always.
More on it later.</p>
<p>In the meantime, welcome back - me to myself.</p>
