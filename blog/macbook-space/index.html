      <h1>Spacing Hard</h1>

      <p>This is going to be short. So I wake early in the morning, had breakfast and
opened my laptop. The machine is a 2020 Macbook Air M1. It is a beast when it
comes to performance and reliability. Me, an avid open source enthusiast
should not be using this but huh it is hard to let this go. I got this one from
work but more on that later.</p>
<p>So, long story short, the space bar was stuck. Not stuck as in stuck but the key
barely had any travel. If you know me, then you know what I will do next. Yes!
Fully confident in my ability to tinker with hardware, I carefully (not really)
disassembled the key (not a big deal, I know). Cleaned the area with isopropyl
alcohol. Tried to put the key back. Now the think won't go in the way which it
came out. I tried to make it push it in but it just did not work.</p>
<p>As a self proclaimed Google (re)searcher, I tried my best at finding resources
on how to do this stuff. I found some Reddit posts, with some guidance but none
of them really helped. But one of them had a link to this video which did help!</p>

          mozallowfullscreen
          allowfullscreen />
</div>
<p>The process is not that hard. It just takes some practice. All it took is a
little push at the right point. My space bar is back to it's former glory now.
Yay! I may try disassemble the whole keyboard now that I am confident.</p>
