title: Spacing Hard
description: I casually tried to clean my laptop space bar and it backfired.

This is going to be short. So I wake early in the morning, had breakfast and
opened my laptop. The machine is a 2020 Macbook Air M1. It is a beast when it
comes to performance and reliability. Me, an avid open source enthusiast
should not be using this but huh it is hard to let this go. I got this one from
work but more on that later.

So, long story short, the space bar was stuck. Not stuck as in stuck but the key
barely had any travel. If you know me, then you know what I will do next. Yes!
Fully confident in my ability to tinker with hardware, I carefully (not really)
disassembled the key (not a big deal, I know). Cleaned the area with isopropyl
alcohol. Tried to put the key back. Now the think won't go in the way which it
came out. I tried to make it push it in but it just did not work.

As a self proclaimed Google (re)searcher, I tried my best at finding resources
on how to do this stuff. I found some Reddit posts, with some guidance but none
of them really helped. But one of them had a link to this video which did help!

The process is not that hard. It just takes some practice. All it took is a
little push at the right point. My space bar is back to it's former glory now.
Yay! I may try disassemble the whole keyboard now that I am confident.
